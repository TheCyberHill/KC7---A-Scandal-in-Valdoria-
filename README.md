# KC7---A-Scandal-in-Valdoria-

🕵️ KC7 Cyber Threat Investigation — Module A: A Scandal in Valdoria
📘 Scenario
Valdoria, a fictional nation, is rocked by a political scandal involving leaked emails, suspicious network activity, and potential insider threats. As a Security Analyst, you’re tasked with investigating the breach using Kusto Query Language (KQL) across multiple datasets.
This repo covers Section 1: KQL 101 and Section 2: Welcome to Valdoria, focusing on foundational query skills and initial threat detection.

🔍 Investigation Highlights
Section 1: KQL 101
- Learned KQL syntax and structure for querying large datasets.
- Practiced filtering, projecting, and sorting data across tables like AuthenticationEvents, EmailEvents, and NetworkEvents.
- Built queries to identify login anomalies, suspicious email subjects, and outbound traffic patterns.
Section 2: Welcome to Valdoria
- Investigated suspicious login attempts tied to political figures.
- Identified email subjects and senders linked to leaked communications.
- Traced outbound network traffic to suspicious domains and IPs.
- Used KQL to correlate events across multiple logs and uncover attacker behavior.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Log filtering, projection, and aggregation
- Threat hunting across authentication, email, and network datasets
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping (implied through adversary techniques)
- SOC workflows: alert triage, log correlation, incident documentation

📘 Lessons Learned
- KQL is essential for SOC analysts to pivot across datasets and uncover attacker behavior.
- Political and insider threats often involve multi-vector attacks (email, network, authentication).
- Structured query logic helps isolate IOCs and build a timeline of compromise.
- Early detection relies on understanding normal vs. abnormal patterns in enterprise logs.
